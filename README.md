# HighSchoolProject-BinaryTreeGuessingGame
This game is based on the Animal Game, which is a computer learning game that can be implemented using binary trees. The user picks an animal, then the computer will ask a series of yes/no questions and guess at what animal the player has selected. If the guess is incorrect, the player is asked to provide a yes/no question that would distinguish the animal selected by the player from the one guessed by the computer. Initially the game starts with only a few animals (and a few question).  Instead of animals, I used anime instead but the concept is the same.  
This project heavily involves serialization and deserialization of a binary tree in order for the computer to "learn" after each play and mistake made.
